Scaling your Flask application to handle multiple users simultaneously is crucial for a smooth user experience. 
Here are some strategies and resources to help you achieve this:

1. Load Balancing
Implementing load balancing is essential for distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers. 
This prevents any single server from becoming overwhelmed. Popular load balancers include Nginx, HAProxy, and AWS Elastic Load Balancing.

2. Using a WSGI Server
Deploy your Flask application using a WSGI server like Gunicorn. 
Gunicorn can handle multiple worker processes, which allows your application to handle more requests concurrently.

3. Caching
Implement caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed data in memory. 
This reduces the load on your server and database. Tools like Redis can be used for this purpose.

4. Database Optimization
Optimize your database queries and consider using a more scalable database solution. 
Horizontal scaling of databases can help manage increased load and data volume.

5. Containerization and Orchestration
Use Docker to containerize your application and Docker Compose or Kubernetes for orchestration. 
This makes it easier to manage and scale your application across multiple servers.

6. Monitoring and Performance Tuning
Regularly monitor your application's performance using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. 
This helps you identify bottlenecks and optimize your application accordingly.
